AS COVID-19 HAS SWEPT THE ENTIRE WORLD, IT HAS LEFT NO CIVILIZED PLACE OF REACH OF ITS EFFECTS. LIFE HAS CHANGED FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYONE IN NEVER EXPECTED WAYS. THE GONZAGA COMMUNITY IS NO EXCEPTION. PROFFESORS HAVE HAD TO SCRAMMBLE TO GET COURSES READY FOR ONLINE DELIVERY. ADMINISTRATORS ARE TASKED WITH FINDING SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS NEVER IMAGINED. THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS CLEAR OFF OF CAMPUS AND INTO OFF CAMPUS HOUSING OR ALL THE WAY BACK TO THEIR HOMETOWNS. STUDENTS, LIKE SO MANY OF US NOWADAYS, ARE WONDERING: WHAT WILL I DO WITH ALL OF MY TIME?? \\

STAN MAN IS STANDING BY 6 FEET AWAY FROM GONZAGA STUDENTS WITH THE WAYS THIS SITUATION HAS EFFECTED THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES.
